transCSSR Overview

The following are general overview notes.

Within the state machine. You will set parameters for transCSSR configurations in ‘transCSSR.py’ and
your project file, for example ‘walkthrough_transCSSR’:

	* alpha is the significance level associated with CSSR's hypothesis tests. 
      The number of degrees of freedom alpha = 0.001
	* name of the data results files are "Xt_name"  & "Yt_name"
	* verbose = False
	* L maximum history length is the look back when inferring predictive distributions.
		  L_max = 3
	* ind_go_to = 20 (number of loops to go through each state)
	* axs, ays = the input / output alphabets

It is always good to use as much data as you can.  High-entropy processes are especially data-hungry.
While it is generally good practice to hold back some data for testing or cross-validation, 
recommend that this be minimized. 

Two key parameters of the program are the maximum history length, L, and the significance level used in the test. 
For any given process, there is a minimum history length M, such that the true states cannot be found if L < M.

Number of states returned may be less than the correct number or higher.

In general, one should use as small an L as possible, since under-sampling, even before the blow-up, 
will reduce the accuracy of many probability estimates.  Blow-up, that is, reducing the probability of 
mistakenly splitting a state --- but this carries the risk of failing to create valid new states.  

Suggest exploring the data at low L and then increasing L.  If a stable architecture is found,
it should be recorded at the lowest possible L.

The various test transducers. Times Series (need to be same length)
    Xt is the input
    Yt is the output.

------------------------ results -----------------------------

The program will create the following files after running, where data file is the name of the parameter
set for "Xt_name"  & "Yt_name"

The results are returned in the file name ending: .dat_results

1. transCSSR_results/xxxx.dat_results
2. transCSSR_results/xxxx.dat

The results contains the information on the inferred states and their properties.  
For each state, it gives:
    * State Number: The results come back with States, each state has a number, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc
    * with position. (
    * Distribution:
    * Transitions:
    * P(State):
